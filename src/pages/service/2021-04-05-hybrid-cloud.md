  - heading: Our Approach
    description: ' <div style=" display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items:
      center; width: 100vw; " > <div style="width: 70vw"> <p> we recommend
      assessing the company’s applications and IT estate and creating a roadmap
      to guide the journey to optimal hybrid cloud. This roadmap should compare
      current and future run costs to create a business case for change; assess
      application and workload placement and data locality options; recommend
      application transformation requirements; consider IT policy and operating
      model factors; and ultimately produce clear, data-based recommendations
      with a proposed execution plan to enable hybrid IT transformation to
      happen. Getting there will require transforming and migrating
      applications, integrating and orchestrating environments, automating and
      monitoring business services, enabling digital processes, and integrating
      data and security. </p> </div> <div style="width: 30vw"> <img
