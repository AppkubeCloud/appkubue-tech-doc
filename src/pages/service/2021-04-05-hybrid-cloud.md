      The first step is for CIOs to connect with the business to establish clear
      lines of communication and to set common goals. Within the IT
      organization, CIOs must set policies that identify the need to prepare for
      hybrid cloud as a priority for overall IT strategies. Then we recommend
      assessing the company’s applications and IT estate and creating a roadmap
      to guide the journey to optimal hybrid cloud. This roadmap should compare
      current and future run costs to create a business case for change; assess
      application and workload placement and data locality options; recommend
      application transformation requirements; consider IT policy and operating
      model factors; and ultimately produce clear, data-based recommendations
      with a proposed execution plan to enable hybrid IT transformation to
      happen. Getting there will require transforming and migrating
      applications, integrating and orchestrating environments, automating and
      monitoring business services, enabling digital processes, and integrating
      data and security. </p> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <img
